          <h3>Viruses(AR), 1920 x 1080, Augmented Readlity, 24 sec, 2020</h3>
          <p>This project was created in March 2020, during the very beginning of the pandemic.</p>
          <p>We never know what is virus looks like, and we can never see it through eyes.</p>
          <p>Therefore we never know its infection.</p>
          <p>An AR perspective of viewing viruses is a way to establish a sense of viruses that can be anywhere around us in daily life.</p>
          <p>To keep people in mind that many viruses are extremely contagious, harmful, and dangerous.</p>
          <p>We should never think it's never a big deal.</p>

          <h3>Virus Animation, 1920 x 1080, Digtal drawing and animation, 3 minutes 45 seconds, 2020</h3>
            <p> The animation is a series I am creating specifically for the period we live in now. </p>
            <p> In this series, I am using both AfterEffect and Photoshop for the entire series due to my artist practice. </p>
            <p> The content of this is to explore the emotion and reaction of people from everyday news reports I seem on the television and network.</p>
            <p> Also, the perspective of people like me viewing this health crisis. </p>              <p> The reason I called it Animation 345 is because I want the length of this animation to be the actual day, which is 345 days.</p>
            <p> Pretend when a disaster like the animation shows, or the crisis we live in now. </p>
            <p> The duration of the crisis can end quickly, like the length of this video 345 days.</p>
            <p>If countries from all over the world work together, accept each other's efforts in solving the crisis. </p>
            <p>The crisis now and the crisis in the future will be less pain, less depressing, and less stressful for everyone compare to what happened up to this period.</p>

      <h3>Personal Space, 1080p x 1920p, Digital drawing, 2020</h3>
      <p>A digital drawing I made in the summer, the time living in pandemic and quarantine at home.</p>
      <p>It’s an expression of me in this comfort zone during the time quarantine at home.</p>
      <p>The background is the place that I like peaceful and quiet, and myself in the center, making a digital drawing. </p>
      <p>The setting is an expression of an inner zone/environment that I feel when I focus on my work, as in the image is showing.</p>
