          <h3>Viruses(AR), 1920 x 1080, Augmented Readlity, 24 seconds, 2020</h3>
            <p> This project was created in March 2020, during the very beginning of the pandemic.<br>
                We never know what is virus looks like, and we can never see it through eyes.<br>
                Therefore we never know its infection.<br>
                An AR perspective of viewing viruses is a way to establish a sense of viruses that can be anywhere around us in daily life.<br>
                To keep people in mind that many viruses are extremely contagious, harmful, and dangerous.<br>
                We should never think it's never a big deal.</p>

          <h3>Virus Animation, 1920 x 1080, Digtal drawing and animation, 3 minutes 45 seconds, 2020</h3>
            <p>The animation is a series I am creating specifically for the period we live in now. <br>
               In this series, I am using both AfterEffect and Photoshop for the entire series due to my artist practice. <br>
               The content of this is to explore the emotion and reaction of people from everyday news reports I seem on the television and network.<br>
               Also, the perspective of people like me viewing this health crisis. <br>
               The reason I called it Animation 345 is because I want the length of this animation to be the actual day, which is 345 days.<br>
               Pretend when a disaster like the animation shows, or the crisis we live in now. <br>
               The duration of the crisis can end quickly, like the length of this video 345 days.<br>
               If countries from all over the world work together, accept each other's efforts in solving the crisis. <br>
               The crisis now and the crisis in the future will be less pain, less depressing, and less stressful for everyone compare to what happened up to this period.</p>

        <h3>Personal Space, 1080p x 1920p, Digital drawing, 2020</h3>
          <p> A digital drawing I made in the summer, the time living in pandemic and quarantine at home. <br>
              Itâ€™s an expression of me in this comfort zone during the time quarantine at home.<br>
              The background is the place that I like peaceful and quiet, and myself in the center, making a digital drawing. <br>
              The setting is an expression of an inner zone/environment that I feel when I focus on my work, as drawing is showing.</p>
